First run of devtools::check() gave the output below.
I've fixed most of it, but some will require further thought...

* After building package, before running devtools::check(), run this:
tools::compactPDF("/home/jerzy/Downloads/RankingProject/inst/doc/primer.pdf", gs_quality = "ebook")
to compact the PDF vignette (in the source directory, not the installed-R-package directory).
Remember to do this before uploading to CRAN!

* What to do with tikzMetrics dictionary?
Can/should I save it in the destination folder where the *installed* package goes?
Seems like I want it while I'm compiling things, in the *source* folder.
But then if I refer to it there, I'm referring to something using a local file path on my laptop,
not a relative file path that others will be able to run on their own machines...
For now, just tossing it out entirely. It'll load slower, but we skip this issue.
For reference, the code was:
options(tikzMetricsDictionary="~/Downloads/RankingProject/vignettes/tikzMetrics")
Should I ask Hadley or StackOverflow about this?

* The inside of NAMESPACE says:
# Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand
so how *should* I add all those importFrom() things as suggested below?
aha, roxygen:
@importFrom pkg fun
Gonna put these in the main package documentation file for now,
RankingProject.R,
then clear out some of them eventually whenever I clean up RankHeatmap().
