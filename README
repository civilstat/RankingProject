The package `RankingProject` is a companion for the article "A Primer on Visualizations for Comparing Populations, Including the Issue of Overlapping Confidence Intervals" (Wright, Klein, and Wieczorek, The American Statistician, 2017).

The functions work, but the package itself is under development: clean up repeated code, add documentation, simplify workflow, etc. This is not yet a stable version.
