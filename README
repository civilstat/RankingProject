The Ranking Project: Visualizations for Comparing Populations
=============================================================

The package `RankingProject` is a companion for the article "A Primer on Visualizations for Comparing Populations, Including the Issue of Overlapping Confidence Intervals" (Wright, Klein, and Wieczorek, 2017, *The American Statistician*, in press).

The package provides functions for plotting ranked tables of data side-by-side with their plots. The available visualizations include shaded columns plots, adjusted confidence intervals, and related plots intended for making correct inferences about one-to-many or many-to-many comparisons.

Installation
------------

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
# library("devtools")
install_github("civilstat/RankingProject")
```

To install the vignettes and exactly replicate figures from the paper, you will also need the `tikzDevice` package:

``` r
# install.packages("tikzDevice")
install_github("civilstat/RankingProject", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Example
-------

``` r
library(RankingProject)

# Load dataset of mean travel time (in minutes) to work
# of workers 16 years and over who did not work at home,
# from the 2011 American Community Survey (ACS)
data(TravelTime2011)

                                    format = 'f', digits = 2),
                            first = 2)

                          est = Estimate.Print, se = SE.Print,

                           plotType = "difference", lwdBold = 2))

# Plot demi-Bonferroni-corrected 90% CIs
